# The Odin Project Ruby Exercises and Projects

## About this repository

This repository is a complement to the
[Ruby course for The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby).
It contains a series of Ruby exercises that must comply pre-written tests.

I (Damian Demasi) have completed the exercises and projects on my own and have
pushed them to this repository.
